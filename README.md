## What is adaptive?
For this example there is only one check of if it is a desktop or a mobile user.

The desktop version is for exploration and the mobile version is geared for the user being at the protest location. 

- The UI changes
- The query options are limited for mobile
- The process of selecting the location of the protest
- Map centers on users location for mobile and zooms in
- Map is zoomed out to world scale for desktop
